Dont bother downloading. Also forces you to pay for a subscription but a subscription for what. Its a fake app that does nothing without the free google maps installed. Total scam and nothing else. The devs will respond with a bogus counter just watch.,1

com.gpsnavigation.maps.gpsroutefinder.routemap,Robin Green,"It took me about two minutes to figure out this app was useless. - The first thing the free app does is present a screen that makes it seem that you HAVE to buy a paid version. Took a while to figure out how to bypass that - I wanted to input a multi-stop route that was about 30 km from my home. It started every step of the route somewhere in Europe even though I'm in Canada. Adding the first stop was okay because I just clicked Current location icon and them slid from there to where I wanted to start my route. But every step after that I had to repeat the process, and there was no way to see the stops I'd already added, making the process of creating a multistop route useless. I don't mind paying for an app once I figure out it works well. This one aggressively tries to make you pay for it, and even the free version has major usability flaws.",1

This app is going to the trash and I will never use it again. I'm not going to fill a complain form. If your programmers are too dumb to understand the danger of displaying ads on the road while people are relying on an app for directions you are not worth it as company. You rather have more deaths for more profits than remove ads from the driving mode.,1

com.sygic.aura,Terry Hull,"I put this app on my Note 10 which incidentally has multiple GPS apps on it that work correctly. The Sygic app works OK until I connect it to Android Auto. That causes the speed display to not change as the speed of the car changes. If I unplug AA, the screen on the phone will update correctly. I sent Email to support and I got back a canned response that had noting to do with this problem. I would be willing to pay for the app, even though I think it is somewhat overpriced to have off-line maps. However, I cannot recommend it for use with AA. I also cannot recommend their application support. They do not seem very responsive to support requests. Incidentally, I also find the screen updates in Sygic to be much less fluid than other apps such as Waze and Google Maps. I see their reaction is, ""Just wait, it may be fixed in a future release."" To me that is not a very satisfactory response to a support request. I'll cancel my trial.",1

TATA Nexon EV is still not in the list in vehicle selection option. Also charging station updation in app is very slow.

com.sygic.aura,Brant Kuykendall,"I would give this a negative star rating if it were an option. I naïvely paid about $80 for additional ""premium"" features before using the app in my pickup, just to find it consistently freezes on my Pixel 6 when connected to Android Auto in my F150 (I'm not sure how you can get a more generic combination than Google's native Android phone paired with the most popular pickup in the US, alas, the combination seems to have missed the radar of the quality assurance team). This has happened after clearing app cache, deleting app data, reinstalls, factory resets, and even a new phone (it was doing the same on my old Pixel 4 before upgrading). I reported the problem several months ago; the support has been dreadfully slow and has done nothing other than ask me to repeat the troubleshooting steps on their Web site. Sygic recently released an update which has resulted in more frequent crashes, and the speed indicator, when it tries to work, now chooses two random values -- between which it alternates -- regardless of your speed of travel. I reported these updates and got a reply advising me that they're aware of the problem, and I should expect a fix in a[nother] future update.",1

com.sygic.aura,Christopher Purdie,"Almost usable. Trying out the free options before I plung in for the paid version. Seems good at first, then random parts of the map start flashing weird colors. No other navigation app does this so it leads me to believe it's an issue with this one. Really sucks because I wanted to live it and pay for additional features but this issue makes it unusable. I will be contacting the developers and offering to send the screen recording I took (while parked of course) so they can look into it.",1

com.sygic.aura,Greg Spath,"I really want to like this, but it has some issues driving me to another solution. First, it often crashes. Second, navigation cues are confusing, often missing exit numbers and showing exits not related to the route. It will also hang at ""1 mile"" as you approach a route's exit. Third, that latter despite turning that feature off in settings. It's quite half-baked on AA, which is unacceptable for an app that requires a $25/year subscription to be useful.",3
com.sygic.aura,Daniel Beneš,"I've been using Sygic for years, but last year after the summer update I started having serious issues with it on Android Auto. I get an error message every 10 or so minutes that stops the navigation while driving and it forces me to click ok to continue to head to the same location. Very annoying. What is worse, however, that after the last map update in February the navigation often freezes. It looks it continues navigation, but it leads you elsewhere. When it happens, i even restarting it does not help. Last 2 trips I had to finish with Google Maps. I even tried to contact the support multiple time, but never received any answer. With me being Premium user for years this is irritating. As much as I love Sygic as it is unique in many ways, I am likely going to replace it with something else as it errors and issues it has on Android Auto might well be fatal for me one day as they take so much attention from driving! From the posts below, I see this is happening also to other people. When this is fixed, I would be happy to return, but until then, SYGIC DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.",2

I tried to use the app on the road and instead of clear navigation functionality there are adverts everywhere (on a lifetime world licence). As far as I am concerned, thumbs down. If I as a customer don't cary much weight in your marketing strategies, luckilly, I have plenty of other options to choose from.",1

It had me arriving at my destination 400 yards before I even reached it, and I spent an hour inputting my frequently visited destinations into the app, only to see about six or seven of them out of the 40 I put in, which brings me to my NEXT gripes: there is a feature that allows to backup my favorites, but only gives Dropbox as a destination, and I'll be damned if I use them ever again. At least allow me to save the backup locally if not in the cloud. And adding favorites from my contacts was a headache, as it failed to recognize many of them as valid addresses, something I'd never seem in other nav apps. I paid for a subscription for 3 months, so there's $12 down the drain.

com.sygic.aura,John Hoit,"Six months after my first bad review: Nothing has improved. I have no idea what mapping data they are pulling from, but it can't even get my own location correct. It thinks I'm at a house number that doesn't even exist on this street plus even though the zip code matches, the town's name is wrong. Every single other map app I try can find me but this one fails miserably. How am I suppose to trust it to put me on the right roads? Will I end up going the wrong way on an exit ramp? This app appears to be designed for outside the USA. What's with the icon? It has that same Google looking confusing blue fan thing trying to indicate what direction you are facing. Is it suppose to be in front of you or behind you??? How about a simple arrow? How hard would that be? It's just as confusing as Google Map's icon. If you are in England or somewhere similar, go ahead and try this. For us American users, it's as useless as a screen door on a submarine and I'm uninstalling with extreme prejudice. WARNING! If you live within the USA, do not trust this map and certainly do not pay a dime to these guys. They don't know what they are doing. PLUS!!!! Change that damn icon and put an arrow there!",1

com.sygic.aura,Georgios Vell,"I bought Sygic and use it for my work. I am using version 18.8.6 of Sygic and i am having problems saving more than 2700 points of interest / favourites. When i exceed that number then i stop having any access to my favourites. I can only see these small blue hearts on the map but it won't allow me to search for them. When i upgrade to the latest version the app crashes every time i open the settings menu. When i upgrade and try to manually insert the favourites file afterwards it just doesn't work. I tried to ask for a solution by opening a ticket several times in the past but i either didn't get a straight answer or not an answer at all. It's a shame that the best navigation system out there has so important flaws and a bad customer support! EDIT: English is not my native language but i think it is clear that i never mentioned that i tried to import routes or POIs from external sources. All the saved locations are saved from within the Sygic application. I am not trying to transfer data from another app to this one. All i am trying to say is that i cannot save any more locations because it stops displaying the existing ones as well. And when / if i update to the latest version the application crashes every time i enter the settings. To sum up, i am now forced to find another navigation app for my work because of the bad or no support at all.",1

About 1 week later, it fails to start once again. I'm instructed to restart, which it does. I see I must pay a premium not only for ongoing map updates, but for Android connection to my car.

I use it into my car android. Make possible to choose several maps to initiate, not the whole Europe as a package (> 10GB).

Seems rather than accepting feedback or trying to make the app more usable all negative feedback is called unfair, that is not an app I want to use. ###UPDATE: I REST MY CASE YOUR HONOR. I have the 3D option on, it doesn't show in 3D, clicking any and all buttons on the screen doesn't result in a 3D view. It's great how you can tell that it's not jittery, better would be if you were correct, the map rotates left and right constantly while traveling in a straight line (Waze, GM etc fine), call that what you wish.

com.mapfactor.navigator,polemon wurst,"After using it for almost eight years now, I have a more balanced look on the app, and sadly - must remove one star. The ads are a little much, especially when they don't auto-close and keep running the battery in the background, when you forget to close them manually. But here come the big ones: downloading maps and updating them is super cumbersome, so much so, that it sometimes is plainly unusable. On a flaky Internet or WLAN connection, the map download will be interrupted and a box will appear asking me if I want to abort the download. In the mean time, the network is back and I can see ads being reloaded under the box. When I click ""No"" to reconnect, the download aborts, it forgets which maps I selected from the download menu (!) and brings me back. I then have to go through the menu, re-select my maps and try again. When I click ""Yes"" to reconnect"" I'm brought to my WiFi settings, where I can see my connection is back and working, but when I go back to the download IT STARTS FROM ZERO! And the whole malarkey begins from start. I have no idea how this went through quality control. Being that the offline maps are a core component of the app, I must remove two stars. Because of this, I had to use OsmAnd as a backup a couple times now. My old review from 2013: OK, let's get this out of the way: It's my favorite navigation app, hands down. I like how you can use OSM maps for navigation, the integration is great and all that. Frankly, the option to buy TomTom maps is pretty neat as well, even though I probably won't use them. The turn-by-turn navigation works very well, probably better than a lower-tier Garmin car sat-nav. OK, but there are some drawbacks: The map view is pretty jumpy and slow, and that on my Google Nexus 7 FHD. Google Earth is pretty fast with 3D objects, but the maps on MapFactor, nope. The interface looks a bit dated, and sometimes it's hard to respond. And finally, with the free version, there is pretty much zero chances of setting destinations by street address. Even putting it into the vicinity doesn't work, so that's pretty sad, I'd say. So given the UI drawbacks, I have to remove one star, otherwise, this is the best free navigation app that uses offline maps, I've seen so far.",3

com.mapfactor.navigator,A Google user,best (offline) navigation and most versatile app out there. Also good support and quick replys by the developers.,5
com.mapfactor.navigator,John Wilson,"Finally got this working. After much frustration... Postcodes were installed but app not 'getting it' at all.. so uninstalled, reinstalled and it now 'gets it'.. huh?? Checked Buxton Raceway and still not accepting it but it at least found the postcode! So it's all good now. Suggest making maps and postcode downloads easier to 'navigate' as seems a bit fussy with me having to deselect many instead of selecting a precise few. Will reactivate subscription now though..",4
com.mapfactor.navigator,Alex Johansson,I like the app. Cleanning and deleting all app related data as suggested by the developer followed by re-install of the app seems to fix apps crashing problem. Keeping my fingers crossed and increasing apps rating.,4
com.mapfactor.navigator,Bernard Konfortov,"The navigator itself is good and I have been using it for years. Unfortunately, the developers chose to load it with very persistent adds, which are extremely annoying and very, very difficult to get rid of. So I find myself using Google maps more and more and am looking around to find a better offline app to replace the Mapfactor navigator. Sorry people, but if you are not going to change this, you are loosing me! And it is not true that the adds could be switched off after 5 seconds!",1
com.mapfactor.navigator,Ivan Ljubic,Verry nice App.,5
com.mapfactor.navigator,Artur,Did not find exact address with the free maps. Can't manipulate map by touch. Developer takes no responsibility and claims my review is unfair because the maps are free.

com.mapfactor.navigator,TDT,Edit: Reduced one star due to deceptive dev response. They know the limitations of offline search and OSM. Previous: Have to pay to search for an address. UI is butt ugly.

It soaks up ALL the phone's resources FOR NOTHING. the navigation is horrible as well, if you ever get the thing to find an address. It will not adjust to the addition of way points, instead it just tacks them to the end and NOTHING you do changes that. I paid for the maps, and I WILL GET THAT MONEY BACK. I don't put in ""coordinates"", I enter an address via standard American Address format. i.e. number street, city, state, zip. I also placed markers for ""start"" and ""stop"" directly on the map. Doesn't matter how I found start and destination, it drained my battery to nearly dead in a matter of Minutes, and every time (without exception) I tried to search a route it would lock up.",1

Not sure how this app can get so many positive reviews. I paid for the app and got the TomTom maps. But recently I have upgraded to a newer device, and to get it working on every new device I have to email the customer care send them the device logs and they will authenticate it. But this pain of getting it sorted was nothing in front of the shock I got when they asked me to pay more to get the latest maps. so, the maps you buy never upgrade. Each time you will have to buy new maps for 8 EURO. which is pathetic as on these ever-changing roads where the speed limits change every day and one new road comes up every other day how can we keep paying for the maps every time???

Response from Dev: ""restart this, or delete that etc"" but the last few updates helped, then not. Also paying for mediocre map upgrades? Hundred dollars wasted....",1

com.mapfactor.navigator,Josef H.,The problem for me is that there is no mute/unmute toggle available in the navigation mode. I would need that option in order to use this app. EDIT: I've reconsidered my rating based on your response. You want me to use the volume buttons to mute/unmute the navigation voice... Seriously? Never mind if I want to listen to something else... That was the most ridiculous advice I could expect from you.,1
com.mapfactor.navigator,malc white,Too many questions before the app opens and it doesn't remember the answers even if you tell it to. Plus the display turns off even with the keep display active button ticked. I had to answer the questions every time I used it.,2

All said I don't know what happened, the developer suggested files got corrupted. eventually ""we"" got Navigator working again.. So Mapfactor Navigator is back to being my goto GPS app 1) It can store all the maps (you want) on your S/D card, therefore when I am traveling ""overseas"" w/o the ability to use cellular data or wifi the GPS still works great 2) very easy and intuitive too save ""favorites"" such as where the 'ship' dropped us off. 3) excellent support, specifically compared to a GPS (automobile) I paid several hundred $$ for, when it had issues I was #$%^ out of luck.",5

That's renders it useless unless you're just looking fort a specific street. I'm using it on my Android car radio. Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong? Do I have to update to the TomTom maps, or is does it allows me to type in specific addresses in the pro version of this app? Which I'm not sure is available in the play store on my car radio. It's Android 6.0.1 TomTom maps do not even include some zipcodes that have been here for 20 years or more. Didn't find that out until after I paid for the offline maps thru TomTom per your suggestion. Also, your premium features, when I tried to purchase them, it would say site is unreachable. Then I tried with a new browser and after entering my credit card info it says ""purchase no longer available"" You're customer support was great, but regardless, almost everything within this app either didn't work or gives errors.

com.mapfactor.navigator,Amy Pagnozzi,Re: UTURN checkbox for every mode. Does checking enable or disable UTURNS? Why can't developers communicate? Pretty good but note that the default offline multistep search mode usually cannot locate street numbers found in Open Street Maps. Onestep offline search usually succeeds but if it fails revert to multistep search and enter cross street as an alternative. I'd sign up for HERE online search (3.49 a year) but you can't even try it once to determine if it is better (or worse).,3

com.mapfactor.navigator,lAlireza,👌👌👌❤️,5
com.mapfactor.navigator,Wil Pounds,Do not download. Full page ads at exit have destroyed the excellent app. You cannot stop the add running without restarting your phone. It was best map app before this update.,1
com.mapfactor.navigator,Ali Cham,"Even its free version is the best and the most useful navigation app, works offline too",5
com.mapfactor.navigator,N P,"I have using this app for 10 years. Ive only had a problem when my sd card had corrupted data, which wasnt an issue with this app. The free os maps are good but not perfect, sometimes have difficulty finding exact locations eventhough it can find the road. This hasnt ever been an issue in practice. Being able to use offline maps and navigate without an internet connection has been very useful, it has gotten me out of some otherwise desperate travel situations",5
com.mapfactor.navigator,Vahid Karimi,very gooa app,5
com.mapfactor.navigator,andy sales,"Doesn't offer multiple route options (as Google maps does) This feature is available on the paid version. The appearance of the free maps is a bit basic, you can pay to upgrade to better TomTom maps though. But all in all, very very good for a free offline navigation app.",5
com.mapfactor.navigator,Melentije Stankovic,confusing,1
com.mapfactor.navigator,Wayno Insanomany,Sometimes wont load otherwise its good,4
com.mapfactor.navigator,cliff123024,Very beautiful colors and accuracy is the best- i love it,5
com.mapfactor.navigator,Miroslav Markovic,I understand maps are free but to recognize one street and next parallel one is unknown!? That is unacceptable....,1
com.mapfactor.navigator,Paul Welink,Van een betrouwbare app (10) na update een vastlopende app (1). Daarom deze beoordeling van 5 naar 1 ster gewijzigd. App blijft herhaaldelijk hangen en mobiel loopt geheel vast. Google zou beter app-store moeten opschonen en dit soort waardeloze app's verwijderen.,1
com.mapfactor.navigator,Jugoslav Stankin,Ok,4
com.mapfactor.navigator,Paul English,Like the app...would be 5 stars if i could could lower the output voice volume....,4
com.mapfactor.navigator,Thomas Schweiger,Shows terrible full screen video ads that you can't even stop playing. Edit: Nothing is unfair about this review! Unbelievable,1
com.mapfactor.navigator,Tom Milinovich,"It works very well for us. I also have the Window's version on my laptop. For shorter trips, I use the smartphone version. For longer trips, I like the larger screen on my laptop.",5
com.mapfactor.navigator,Don Mc,"A really nice GPS app with a lot of features. I really like the scale on the map, very helpful! So many features it takes some getting used to. Upgrade to premium package failed with phone connected to ethernet cable, a lot of apps do not support all of their features when phone internet connection is through the ethernet cable for some reason.",4
com.mapfactor.navigator,Dennis Carter,"It is good to have a map program that is independent of the internet, so that I can use it in remote areas. I have used it for years, and love this feature. Unfortunately, this past week, it seems not to function without the internet. I have made this ""malfunction"" known to the developer, just a few minutes ago. I await their response. Otherwise, it is a great program that I have recommended to several friends.",4
com.mapfactor.navigator,S&H Orchard,Ok,4
com.mapfactor.navigator,Klaus Garage,Ok,5
com.mapfactor.navigator,Nic P,"Big improvement to the layout, very useful navigation app.",4
com.mapfactor.navigator,john caufield,"No need to use a separate GPS anymore ! Thanks to osm community , and to authors . How much would a GPS with world coverage , and lifetime updates cost ! Hope this review offsets some from people who are incapable , or who can not find ""settings"". Addendum : May 2018 , The best there is, a great user interface and worldwide cover and free updates. Absolutely wonderful. Also goes on sd card , saving a lot of memory. Just short of alternative routes, which is premium. Still the best 🙂.",5
com.mapfactor.navigator,Morteza Roostapisheh,Very good,5
com.mapfactor.navigator,MOHAMED MOUH,Greate app,5
com.mapfactor.navigator,Tania Vo,Usefull and free. Thank you.,5
com.mapfactor.navigator,Juneiro Lance Lanche,"Some city are just empty. Not like other offline gps app. Edit: You said its been fixed but its not. Still missing some parts of map. Re-edit: I understand that you made the app but not the map itself, but how come that the maps from osm that are accessed by other apps are completely fine with theirs, like sygic, and here we go. However on mapfactor, its missing. So I think there's something wrong with your app.",1
com.mapfactor.navigator,Suada arifi,Good,4
com.mapfactor.navigator,Tom Hoosac,"Now able to use a 1-line address,city,state input! With a multitude of window setups, I cannot find an ETA which I think is one of the more important ones.",5
com.mapfactor.navigator,Erickson Canieso,"this app is nice before no fee but after a year, you need to buy a map ""new version""",5
com.mapfactor.navigator,Tahir D,I paid £15.99 for tom-tom Turkey. It has not downloaded the map. Can you please resolve or refund.,1

com.mapfactor.navigator,Lavdim Guri,Super,5
com.mapfactor.navigator,vasile zbereanu,"Before was better. I use it from 2016 and never had problems, but with last version in 2 months almost evreytime had problem. Or i can not download the map, or have to wait gps signal for half hour, or somthing else. Before was better, much better",5
