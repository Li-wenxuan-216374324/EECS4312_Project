com.tortel.syslog,Jacques Bertrand,"Use this command in ADB to grant the permission necessary for reading logs on unrooted phones: adb shell pm grant com.tortel.syslog android.permission.READ_LOGS  Thank you for this great little app making saving & sharing logs so fast & easy.  My Galaxy Galaxy S3 has ROOT & running LineageOS 14.1 which is based on Android 7.1 (Nougat).  I don't understand reviewers giving only 1 star because they can't read the description above which clearly says ""Root is required for Android 4.1+"".  It's not the app's fault if they are blind! Working great also on Galaxy S5 G900M klteub running LineageOS 15.1 (Oreo 8.1) and on Pie 9.0 (LineageOS 16.0). I used the adb permission on a NOT rooted Galaxy S5 Mini G800H running stock Samsung 6.0.1 Marshmallow & it also works fine on it.",5
