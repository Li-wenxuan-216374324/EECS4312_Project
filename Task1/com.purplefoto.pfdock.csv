com.karson.android.cardock,A Google user,"I haven't tried everything, but most things seem to work fine. However, I thought by setting ""custom music"" I would be able to set my preferred media player to start, which is TuneWiki Pro. On my Droid Razr, by default I'm only given two media players to choose from, Google and Motorola, neither of which I care for. Where it says ""custom music"" I thought I'd be able to change that. I was wrong. I'm uninstalling for now.",3

com.autolauncher.motorcar.free,Benjamin Grant,"Very good launcher. I have one of those clone headunits that embed into the dash. (secaine, xtrons etc). The default launcher on my xtrons was bland to say the least and never offered any customizations. This one here is very impressive. Alot of work has gone into it and I can say it works very well. What sets this apart from other launchers? 1. themeable - plenty of themes to alter how it looks, 2. has very decent control over any audio player that uses system notifications. (if the audio app doesn't work with this then its the audio app not the launcher) 3. the mini map on the homescreen is excellent - extremely useful (I wonder if it can have an imbedded waze or embedded tomtom go?) 4. surprisingly for its fancy high-end look it doesn't slow the system down. seems to run really good. what could make it better? there are apps such as DAB-Z / FM radio app etc I wonder if they can output the info to the music widget with << >> acting as seek up / seek down or in the way of dab-z station up / down...

com.autolauncher.motorcar.free,Steve J,"After trying several car apps, this is by far the best one, with Android Auto coming in a close second. AA would be better with a few changes, but I think for now I'll try this one out. The grey theme is definitely the best IMO, though it could be much better. It looks like it's very customizable, so I could probably make it very close to what I'd like, but I'm not ready to pay for it yet, which is required to customize. I'm also not convinced a car app would be preferable to running waze and a music player in split screen. I do have concerns about this app due to it not being updated in months and some reviews indicated a lack of support. If it does well with some on-road testing and it receives more updates, I may buy it. I also have concerns due to the permissions these car apps require and this being a Russian app, but this one doesn't seem to need accessibility service access, which is the one I'd be mainly worried about.",4

I would like to see on the main screen in the music box a channel switching/searching button, a text telling me which station is actually on, showing actual frequency and what is actually playing (read from the RDS radio signal if available).  If you can add that, this will be a perfect app.  Also allow adding widgets!  Also the app says ""No internet connection"" if only 3G network is working and no Wi-Fi is available. Yes, my auto radio is connected to 3G network with its own SIM card, so it would be nice if the launcher could recognize that.",4

Ofc u can add Google Maps app in the interface .. but it is not practical to keep switching between apps when driving. This feature is like the same in ""Dash"" drive app. *A dialer would be great too. *A music only interface or Maps only interface or both combined in a nice and crisp way would be awesome. =as for a new app , it is doing a great job and i wish it will have those features listed above in the future updates .

Also installed a dialer app that goes into landscape mode for easy number dialing while driving. All together goes very nicely hand to hand - my s7 is on a dashboard and just with one click i can access needed app. Simplicity and great design is what i like the most, couse too much info at the same time could be a little confusing on other apps.

spinninghead.carhome,Rob Welham,"Great, to a point. No updates for over a year, which in itself is fine, but given the demise of Google Play Music one might have hoped for an update to facilitate YouTube Music integration particularly with respect to creating the ability to add playlist shortcuts. With regards everything else it's generally better than Android Auto app. YTM doesn't go into landscape mode [not this apps fault] so before evening turning the ignition I have to hit another app to force everything into landscape. As for other functionality, it's great. Big buttons, making calls easier to make on the move. Other display information is also useful such as weather, etc. Can't find the Safety feature that facilitated an auto-response SMS when on the move. In general this is a great app, only let down by the way other apps - eg. YTM, the phone dialer etc - interact with it.",3

spinninghead.carhome,Michael Smith,"I have used this app for several years and through several phones, but the lack of updates has limited its usefulness.

Nice to be able to program the camera button on the home screen.",3
spinninghead.carhome,K. Callis,"Once upon a time, this was my go to app for auto interaction. Back then, my biggest complaint was the integration with the phone app. Now in 2021, there have been no updates in 2 years and definitely does play nice with Android 11. For instance, I have CHU exit when the initiating Bluetooth device shutdown. Or a least I thought it worked. Now, even with the Bluetooth device turned off, CHU keeps turning itself on until I do a force stop of the app. Not cool!",2

spinninghead.carhome,Alex Benthem,"Best car environment to use. Keeps the music and navigation apps as they are, unlike android auto, that make Tidal, Spotify or Plex or Waze, Google maps, etc. look weird. The only issue I have found is that on the music viewer page. The covers from Tidal do not work (controls do, but no covers). This doesn't happen with Plex, plexamp, Spotify, amazon music, etc. All those show music covers fine. There is something with Tidal that makes it a bit incompatible. I hope someone fixes this issue.",5
spinninghead.carhome,Mark Palmos,"Dead? No updates for 20 months!!? in general this is OK but misses the most basic thing which is a major problem - it does NOT start playing music as soon as the app opens. You cannot get this to happen, there is no setting for it... so you have to fiddle with your phone as soon as you get in the car. ANNOYING. Also when you are on a call, the home button doesn't go back home, which is a big problem if you are navigating somewhere and get a phone call, you cannot get back to your map! If you pull down notifications and then select to go back to Carhome Ultra, doesn't work either. Pressing the floating Carhome Ultra button also doesn't work, so you're stuck on the dialer... major problem... also it seems the developer has lost interest in this app.",2

I use it literally every single time I get into my car, to launch my GPS app (Waze) and my podcast app (PlayerFM), and sometimes I use the audio player function when I'm not listening to podcasts to listen to Amazon Music.

This can get annoying and it would be good to be able to turn off the announcement but still keep the location displayed (EDIT: Figured out where the setting was for this). 2) You can set a speed alarm, but it is fixed. A competing app displays the actual speed limit for the road and the speed alarm is set relative to the posted speed limit. 3) Voice announcement of caller so that you know who's calling without looking at the screen. 4) Voice announcement and option to read out text messages (this feature is present on a number of competing apps) 5) Key pad on call screen. The larger button to hang up the call is nice, but an option to display a large keypad is required for dealing with calls to recipients that use DTMF tones for options menus.",4

spinninghead.carhome,Tyler Bewley,"This app makes it a lot less distracting to use your phone while driving. The buttons are big, so there's no need to stare at the screen and struggle with finding the buttons with your finger. The shortcuts are also very helpful. The only issue I've found is that when I go to play Spotify through the app, it doesn't always display the song, sometimes it just says ""Spotify."" I've figured out a way to get around this by opening Spotify from the app, pressing play on the song, and then returning to the car home app, but it'd be nice for it to work straight from the car home app. Not sure if this is a fixable issue, but I'd be happy to see this work.",5

spinninghead.carhome,Brian F,"Update on March 18th 2017: thank you very much for fixing the Slacker media controls and also it now shows the artist information properly.  One strange thing I've been noticing that is still not fixed is when this app is active the Okay Google phase response no longer works properly.  It starts and then instantly stops. When I'm not running this app it works fine.   Excellent design, well thought out and very customizable.  I really love the day / night mode, media control, address display and location announcement.  The ability for the Home button to bring you back to the app is really nice too.  I emailed the developer about the title and artist not displaying for Slacker and he said if the app sends the info, he displays it.  Maybe Slacker is sending it in a different way but I know there is some way for it to be displayed.  My Moto 360 displays Slacker info just fine.  Also, he said he was working on an issue with the Title / Artist not clearing from the Media Screen once the source app is closed (Pandora, Google Play, etc.).  For example, when I'm playing something from Slacker, the last song I played on Pandora was displaying.  Hopefully he can make the buttons on the Media Screen more customizable, such as color, solid (not just outline).  They are very hard to see in daylight.  I have to use these now since the Media Controller buttons no longer work and I was told those are going away.  Other than those few things, I love the app!",5
spinninghead.carhome,Juan Pena Jr.,"App worked very well until very recently... Google voice updated to Google Assistant and ever since, I can no longer use it when this car dock app is launched.

spinninghead.carhome,Brad Bogle,"Great App! I  have using this app since back when I had a Samsung GS3 and an iBolt car dock that would output audio through the USB micro port.

Also lets me launch Waze, GasBuddy and any other apps I need while I'm driving. The direct dial (basically speed dial) function is great too.",5
spinninghead.carhome,Joseph Tolarski,I've used CHU for a few years and agree that it's the best car dock out there but the OK Google voice activation is broken now.

Google Nav is good but it does not show as much detail & traffic on smaller roads - i use big traffic view to change route on the fly - sat nav not as adaptable as me. Edit: found a great maps app so Car Home Ultra is now 5 star for me.",5

In fairness this didn't happen on my old Sony Xperia Z but does on my Samsung Galaxy S5 running Android 6.0.1 Very frustrating as I have to put CHU in Day mode and manually switch it to night mode when driving at night.

Facebook messenger heads, phone, nothing will draw.  Moto Z Force DROID, on Android 7.0  EDIT:  In response to your response, it's not a dialer app issue. I only have the issue when Car Home Ultra is active and in car mode. It won't allow ANY app to draw over the screen. The phone ringing is a drop down draw over effect, much like Facebook Chat  Heads (hence the mention of them).

spinninghead.carhome,Armands Vitols,"Very good app for a car multimedia and nav. I'm using a Lenovo 3 Tab Essentials specially purchased for a car multimedia system . At a moment only few suggestions I could say in my opinion that could be useful. First (if it is possible of course) is to add a setting choice not just start app when it connects to specific bluetooth device but to force tablet/phone to wake up if it is in sleep mode. So it won't  be necessary to push the power button. That would be very usefull, specially for people  who want to build screen in dash or some box and button wont be easy accessible. And second tough is about a media controls. They are fine.  Only think in my opinion is possibility to add (if wanted) rewind buttons (could be buttons, some swipe method or time bar) to main media control screen not just on media control shortcuts. That shortcut thing isn't that bad, but when you drive, there are too many actions that distract you from driving.",5

This is an app that I really want to see working smoothly.  UPDATE: SEP 2016 I have now been using Car Home Ultra for over month and have added a star. This has quickly become my most used app. I run my business from within my vehicle and this app makes it easy to accomplish that. I have mine configured so that it starts and stops automatically  as soon as it detects that I am in the car (my bluetooth radio in the car triggers it),   The issues that I mentioned above seem to have been resolved.

What I mean is this: when I am driving and the app is running, and after a minute it goes into sleep mode...I should be able to simply tap the screen and the app wakes up without me having to draw my screen lock pattern to unlock the phone. If you guys can figure out a setting to overcome this, or maybe I am just missing the setting, please let us know!",4
spinninghead.carhome,Suli,Hud mode would be nice,3
spinninghead.carhome,DonZ,Just wish it was more customization like more themes and options to change icons and a way to announce cities even if the app isn't on top,5

spinninghead.carhome,Marc Monette,"In the advanced options, I have selected the use Samsung hands free and it still won't read my texts. What's going on?",3
spinninghead.carhome,Y K,Navigating this app is just as distracting as navigating the Android UI menus. The only way this app would be worth its premium price would be if it opened other apps such as maps and music within its own custom UI so you could switch between apps properly instead of pressing back which is stupid. This app is only worth a trial and I'm glad mine is over.,1

spinninghead.carhome,Jason Cotting,"Great app. I bought the unlocker. Dev is very responsive and added a feature I requested. I use Tasker with the app, but the Dev keeps adding things that make it less necessary. It's nice to have big buttons that minimize my need to look away from the road when playing podcasts/music. I prefer the digital speedometer on the app over the analog one that comes with my car. The speed alert helps me to not speed as well.

spinninghead.carhome,Tiger Tron,I'm giving it 3 stars only cause if don't touch the screen in my phone it will shout down with the app and I want it to stay open without having to touch the screen before 30sec pass that's a really big problem to me the only way to avoid this problem is to program my phone to never auto shout down and when I do that I forget to shout the phone down myself when I am using another app and my phones battery dies much faster like that,3

spinninghead.carhome,David Perez,"Works well. The Interface design could be cooler looking. Hopefully you can add the option for theme downloads or something. Also, when trying to play audio from SiriusXM or Podcast Addict this app has to open the other apps in order to use them.

spinninghead.carhome,Stan Kaliski,I REALLY Liked this app but I found the constant location updates very annoying. You need to add an option under system settings/sound that allows user to mute location updates. Not sure if I want to purchase app until this is possible.

spinninghead.carhome,mark anderson,Too much setup found better moved on.,2
spinninghead.carhome,Steve Wertheimer,"All in all, decent app, but there are some very annoying shortcomings, which do not appear in similar apps. One annoyance is that when you press the home button, it does not return to the CHU home screen, it just stays on whichever CHU screen it was on.  All launchers have that option, as well as most other car dock apps.   2nd, when you answer or make a call, the phone screen eventually goes blank.  The developer blames Google for this in e-mails which he has written to me, but it's simply not the case.  I purchased DashDroid and it doesn't have this issue at all - and does return to the default home screen when you press the home button.  App has been buggy since I purchased it over 2 years ago, through every release of Android since 4.0.  Sometimes the home button sends me back to the stock launcher, and sometimes to CHU.",3
spinninghead.carhome,Nick Chapman,"Rewriting my review.  Firstly, incorporate default settings so that Bluetooth and GPS turn on with the app if docked. And use the preferred Stamina mode if not.  Get Mirrorlink certification and allow it to run apps full screen from within CHU..  that would make it a lot more useful..  Implement a voice control feature, and a side bar mode (where you can run your navigation app whilst your chosen favourites show on a side bar), would be the best app available.",4
spinninghead.carhome,Paul Harry Barron,"When trying to configure the app, it always crashes",2
spinninghead.carhome,Stefan Frank,"Has been working as expected, especially liked the quick launch of google maps navigation.

Now, with this app and a simple vent mount, I just need to reach out and tap a few buttons to control music. The sleep mode is very useful when I don't want to charge the phone. Sleep mode also inherently disables the need for the Android lock screen, which is a huge bonus. The battery widget is great for monitoring heat. The music controls work well with Spotify. The enter/exit triggers are extremely helpful as well. My only complaint is the aesthetics. I'd prefer it to align with material design, and have a better looking screen saver. However, I've yet to find a replacement that functions as well as Car Home Ultra.",5
spinninghead.carhome,Gregg Collins,"Great way to safely access driving and travel related apps and data when used with a properly located vehicle dock or cradle.

spinninghead.carhome,Mike Ellis,"A car dock app that allows you to use Spotify as your default media player, this is brilliant. I hate been forced to use the in built media player on the Samsung Car mode app.   Absolutely love the auto start and auto close features.   My only gripe would be that CHU can send a stop command to the media player when disconnecting from cars charger and/or Bluetooth but when you place phone (Samsung s6 edge) back in the dock later and press play it doesn't resume meaning you have to open Spotify and press play",5
spinninghead.carhome,Felipe Pubillones,"App is taking long again to launch upon Bluetooth connect. Launches twice when Bluetooth connects. Have it set do home button returns to the app when active, but fails most of the time. And also don't really see any material design elements. Still the same layout and design. New skins simply eliminate the gaps between tiles. Nothing out there quite as feature rich as this app though. Wish I could rank 2.5 stars. Most other docks I rank under 1 star for being mostly useless.",2
spinninghead.carhome,Matt Droms,"Especially love the ""start up when BT and power connected.""  2 issues: the home button does not take me to CHU, it still goes to normal (portrait oriented) home screen; phone calls also display in portrait orientation, which is then sideways in my car dock. Those features worked with galaxy S3, but not on Note 4.",4
spinninghead.carhome,Joe Sebo,"Wish Item: Move / drag and drop tiles /apps or shortcuts around from screen to screen would make customization easier.  Otherwise, this is a polished and well thought out app. Must have for driving. Several screens to put your top apps in easy view and with media controls, what's playing, etc. Home button takes you right back to the app. Feel much safer driving and my wife does too!  Also tracks the city and street you are on. Awesome! Closing the app still needs some work. Also NEEDS BACKUP.",3

spinninghead.carhome,Jonathan Itin,"Bought and used this app a couple years ago.  Worked great until 4.2 ruined it with the home button.  Used the home patch but, while a good workaround, it wasn't an ideal solution.  Fast forward to yesterday.  Tried this app again and it is back to being perfect.

spinninghead.carhome,Matthew Bucher,"I can't see a single one of the widgets at the top or left of the screen during the process being useful for the entire duration of any drive. All except three of the widgets use gps and the third one uses my data, I'm sure that extra process takes extra and unnecessary battery life, which in turn gets me less battery charge for the gas I use to charge it on some occasions. It would make this app better to give the option of disabling them,   I love the music player controls and how easy this app is to use, close out of, customize.. I don't see any ads so far, so I thank you for that, less distractions for when you need to keep your focus on other things, so I did not let the one complain I have reduce my rating, but c'mon, nobody wants to be stuck with a widget like these in effect when you're trying to conserve battery.

spinninghead.carhome,raul passeggi,The voice  can be improved since it sounds as if the voice recorder is kind of sad telling you your location and temperature.,4
spinninghead.carhome,Doug Williams,I really enjoy this app. I useh it with AppRadio unchained and it works pretty well. It would seem it wants you to upgrade the paid version after a little bit of time. I would like to see a little bit more customization and theming involved if that is the case.,4
spinninghead.carhome,A Google user,"I have yet to find anything I need a car dock app to do that this one doesn't. Highly recommended, fantastic app. Frequently updated, too!",5
spinninghead.carhome,Scott Easton,"For some reason I am unable to create a shortcut for Pandora.  Stitcher, Tuneln, Scout, etc all can be set up as a button on my screen, but it doesn't recognize the Pandora app.  Why?",3
spinninghead.carhome,Nitin Bhujbal,I like it its good,4
spinninghead.carhome,RJ Mari,There are a lot of little bugs and annoyances with this app. It needs a major rework. The last straw for me is that it is a huge memory hog in android 5.0. It stays awake in the background even after force closing it. Switching to Ultimate Car Dock which is less buggy and looks a lot better.,3
spinninghead.carhome,A Google user,Love the single colour night mode and the simple interface looks absolutely beautiful. I do a lot of night driving and this looks great in my car. Is there any way to make the whole phone single colour night mode for example google maps. This would really be cool as everything can look like it's part of the interface. Full colour screens are really off putting at night in a car and most people find red or orange only is perfect and non intrusive.,4
spinninghead.carhome,Claude Benshaul,Since the last update the battery meter no longer shows the voltage. Weird. It would also be extra nice if you can find a way add a way to quickly select an app that is already running because currently you need to re select it from the dashboard.,4
spinninghead.carhome,Kris Krisskins,Only wish it would stop opening whenever I put it on charge. I can't find any setting for it and it's really annoying.,4
spinninghead.carhome,A Google user,"I am sure like many they use this device to connect to the car, and I understand its got many features that I may not understand completely, BUt one seems to be missing that seems critical. There is a feature that changes the Home button when your active and does not change back to regular Home button until you exit, why is this also not a feature of the bluetooth? I have a Bluetooth Dongle that I need to manually connect to to work correct and then when I exit it stays connected. Anyway to add a feature that when I enter the program it connects to a certain bluetooth and stays connected till I exit? When I shut off my car the bluetooth is not powered down so the current feature is not good for me where it shuts down when bluetooth is off?  I have used this App on 4 Phones over the few years and I have purchased the app...  love its clean lines and love the music feature integrated with i Heart even tho its a bit confusing on what settings will make it react in what way. Like when I exit the app the music starts back up... no way to force the iHeart to exit?  Droid X, Droid Bionic, Droid Ultra Maxx and now Droid Turbo.. Sadly no Dock features for some retarded reason.",5
spinninghead.carhome,Binu Mathew,Three stars are for Sharing your hard worked product for free. It has some useful functions but to be useful while driving it needs to have a totally hands free operation. Something like an 'OK google' voice response will be beneficial. That is integration of the features in the form of an assistant which could be accessed anytime during the drive and make it really hands free. Also it should turn on Bluetooth without asking avoiding another pressing of the button. All the best for your improvements.,3
spinninghead.carhome,Yuvaraj R,R.k.y,4
spinninghead.carhome,Bartholomew Lemonhead,It's just car mode. Something I had on my old mytouch 4g. The app advertises itself as free but it's only for a trial run.,3

spinninghead.carhome,Jeff London,"This is a great companion app for my Pioneer AppRadio3 (and ARUR).  All my favorite apps are at my fingertips with clear and big icons.  I can swipe from screen to screen with no delays.

spinninghead.carhome,John Scott,If you spend much time in your car you need this app!,5

spinninghead.carhome,Mark Freeman,It was running perfect for a few months. There are a few bugs now but I am still a happy customer and don't regret my purchase at all.  One new issue is that it keeps asking me for GPS to be enabled when it's on. Brightness settings also don't seem to work. I have to use powertoggles to set brightness and screen timeout before hitting the road. Occasionally it won't auto launch on Bluetooth connect with my vehicle. Needs an app menu shortcut so I don't have to go to my launcher home screen to start an app.,4

spinninghead.carhome,Sander Veeken,"It's a great app with a useful homescreen. I got it because my Note 4 car home doesn't allow me to set Spotify for music app. However CHU doesn't effectively become my temporary home button app (yes I've found the setting and enabled it). So whenever I'm navigating and want to find some music, I hit home and I'm back on my Nova Launcher home screen. That makes it practically useless as a car home.

spinninghead.carhome,Ben Humes,"Nice, simple, easy to use interface.  There are two things keeping me from buying it...1) I think that Google maps and navigation should be integrated into the app.  I'd like to be able to see my ""side bar"" things like weather, battery life, etc. While also having navigation up. In addition to maps/navigation, having the phone integrated into the app would be nice too since once the call starts the orientation goes to portrait.  2) setting the app to become the ""home screen"" while running isn't working.",3

Had I been actually driving the speed it said I was I probably would not have been pulled over. One morning in court and $140 later, I deleted the app and will rely on the old faithful speedometer.",1

spinninghead.carhome,Jason,"I use this app literally every day to integrate with my note 2. I use it for speed dial calls, sat nav, torque and reading aloud text messages. Looks great at night too with auto switching night colouration to match my dial colours. Bluetooth auto start works very well, I get in the car and the app starts. If you have a car and a mobile then you need this app.",5

spinninghead.carhome,A Google user,"I've been using this application since it first came out, and it has gotten better and better with each update.  I have a Nexus 5 and this application is the perfect travel companion for this phone.  I havethe Nexus 5 set up to launch CarHome when I start the Android Car Mode, and Carhome then stops WiFi and launches Bluetooth for connecting to my wireless audio connection.  Upon exit, Carhome stops Bluetooth and then starts WiFi, and also controls the GPS starting and stopping as needed.  This application",5

Recommended a free app to diagnose my phone's (Samsung S3) GPS. Turns out that was the problem, now everything works!  Great app & excellent customer service. I bought the paid version (Ultra).

spinninghead.carhome,A Google user,"Excellent, top notch as always, my go to car app since my old Droid X days.",5
spinninghead.carhome,ED Deadmeato,This app is a godsend for people who need to use their phone for listening to music or podcasts whole in the car.  It automatically pops up and keeps the screen on while in the cradle.  The large buttons allow me to get around quickly and easily without having to take my eyes off of the road.  Main con is that this app can take a while to load up if you have more than 1 or 2 operations within the load up process.,4
spinninghead.carhome,taylor burns,It was better whe the app had the navigation app in fix it back and ill 5 star,2
spinninghead.carhome,Tim G,"For starters, the two ""review"" links offered by the app developer are dead, rendering these independent reviews of his product harder to locate.  It's also important for prospective users to understand this is a trial version that only works for 30 days, before you are required to purchase a license key. So far, however, I have loved the app's functionality and easy-to-understand layout. Won't take much convincing to trust that CarHome Ultra is the flagship product in its category.",4
spinninghead.carhome,Karen Vedus LMFT,"I had too many issues with HTC one's built in car app, so installed this and am very happy, except for 2 little things...1.  don't like voice telling me town i'm in every few minutes, and when music pauses for maps to give direction, doesn't always restart and I must go to music app to restart.",4
spinninghead.carhome,Super D,Wow what an app,5
spinninghead.carhome,Girish Tharwani,"In trial period, I will probably buy it. A few improvements will be nice though... like the UI is dated. Honestly it is ugly. The app icons pixilate because I guess the app tries to stretch them to fit in the squares. Like ""Ultimate Car Dock"" if it can read the incoming messages, announce the incoming calls and allow responding to messages by voice, it will be really great.

spinninghead.carhome,Erik Strack,"I've had an excellent experience with this car-dock overall on my Moto X with Republic Wireless. Very configurable.

spinninghead.carhome,James Grimm,"I love this app, but I can't stand how it announces the road I'm near, and I can't seem to find a way to turn it off. Advice?",4
spinninghead.carhome,Jeremy Lynnes,I have a Pioneer AVH-8500BHS deck in my truck and use the AppRadio mode to mirror what is on my screen of my HTC One M8.  This app works great with the deck and allows me to control everything right from my head unit.  This app is much more powerful than the car mode app that the phone comes with.  Very happy with this and it's worth the small investment.,5

com.anod.car.home.free,Angry D,All my reviews start with this complaint: I should not be forced to join a social network just to review free apps! Google+ sucks!  Compact and doesn't kill battery or memory. Customizable and easy to use. What's not to like?,5
com.anod.car.home.free,Andre Curvo,I love,5
com.anod.car.home.free,Nathan Brenner,Thanks,4
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Works fine with Galaxy S 2 epic.,5
com.anod.car.home.free,Kevin Potter,"I've had this WIDGET for yrs, and landscape mode has always been there, great WIDGET",5
com.anod.car.home.free,Ryan Carson,Cannot find after download....I will provide a rating after I can use it.,2
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,What a useful tool -- thanks a bunch!,5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Really convenient,5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,"After install it doesn't show up in list of widgets so it can't be added to a home screen.  Only shows up as an app in system settings under ""manage apps"".",1
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Like the widget config.  Good customizability for sizing wind color.  Use this every time I drive.,5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Need the app to go into landscape mode when the phone is turned on its side,2
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Title says everything!,1
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Option for more rows would be nice.,5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,It's a great little widget with a lot of customizable features.,5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,makes me wonder feel stupid for wasting money on other widgets that don't work for crap,5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,I went through hoops to get car home to work on my nexus 7 just to find it is limited on ics+ devices.  Installed yours and it is perfect for what I need.  Buying pro version just to show my support.,5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,"Has it all, the developer really needs to explain that landscape mode only works when docked as I uninstalled until I realised that it worked exactly as I wanted.",5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Great concept but once installed couldn't open. No shortcut and not under apps list. Not even an open button through google play! :(,1
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Every option in settings requires the paid version to use.  What a joke!  Way to let anyone try this out without attempting to get them to buy it first.  If there was a way to give 0 stars.....thats what you would get.,1
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,"good GUI, easy setting",4
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,"Highly customizable, functional and free! Nice one dev team, I wish more app makers thought like you, highly recommended.",5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Outstanding app,5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,"Just love it. Simple, easy.",5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Very usable widget for car use. Easy to access.,5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Nice to have a car widget as opposed to a dock that only works with the manufacturer car dock.  Would like to see more options to customize but other than that I really like it.,4
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Useless for me without landscape mode. My Droid x comes with a car dock app but this is way better because of all the options. Don't understand how it could be missing a landscape mode. Will be happy to change to 5stars.,1
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,"Its kind of tough to figure out the right way to customize it, but keep trying and you'll understand it. Other then that, works like a dream for a free app. Looks nice as a 4x4 widget on my S3 as well. Dont pay when this free one does the job so well",5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Installed it and it doesn't even run. No icon assigned to Home page or anywhere. Can only uninstall it from All Apps. When connecting to car dock you do get asked to use the default Car Mode or Car Widget. I select Car Widget and it reverts back to non car mode completely as if the phone isn't in the dock at all.,1
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,When placing widget on home screen it thinks got an hour and doesn't work. Very disappointing,1
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Using my nexus 7 tablet as my car media center.....just what i needed....awesome,5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Does what it does.,5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Awesome yaar,5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,"Works great on my Sensation 4G, I was able to set up 2 separate homescreens, one for maps and navi, one for music and audiobooks. Those of you complaining about no way to open it should learn how to use your phones, instead of blaming someone else for your lack of knowledge. It's a widget, not an app. It doesn't open.",5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,"It says widget in the title, folks. I think by now most of you should know how to launch a widget. If you don't, you shouldn't be rating the app down. You should be doing the five second of research you need to find out what that is. Like reading the description, where it also says that Car Mode is only available the pro version.",4
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,"Only shows an uninstall button, no Open and it doesn't appear in App List",1
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Bought pro version which then wouldn't let me use any pro features and told me to upgrade,1
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,"Just what i was looking for, simple,small app, and very customizable..tidied up my phone immensely, thanks dev ******",5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,ICS Support please,3
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Awesome!,5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,This is horrible all the settings to enable car mode don't work unless you buy the whole app. You can't even enable it manually WTF.,1
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,"Very attractive. Very useful. Very ad-less. Nice job, dev",5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,I use this for my 6 most important apps right on my homescreen rather than a car mode. it is perfect for that,5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,App lets me set up shortcuts to 6 apps with big buttons that are easy to see and press while driving. Selection of themes is an added bonus.,5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,"WON'T OPEN
(HTC incredible 2)",1
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,But not for me,4
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,There are better apps out there for what this app tries to do.,1
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Very good app. No problems at all,5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,"It is ""free"", but no features are available unless you pay, and I'm not paying before I know if it works!",1
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Works great but takeup a whole page,5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,"Don't bother with all those other complex car docks, this is perfect and a simple idea. Looks nicer than the others too.Nice one, 1up.",5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,I give it a 3 star for the size.. it takes up my whole screen ...should be adjustable like the font size is ...other than that it works great on my sprint Google nexus..,3
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,pay and unespected phone call w cost no thanks,1
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,all useful options are locked in the free version.,2
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Downloaded it and it just don't open crap feel worry for the ones who bought it,1
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,It does not work. It just crashes,1
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,"Can it disable phone locking (with alphanumerical password) after a call? My problem is, that company policy is forced the phone to lock the phone. On Andriod the phone immediately locked after a call even if you set any screen timeout. It's nearly impossible and dangerous to type your password to unlock the phone on the highway :)",4
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,"Works good on razr XT910. Would be better if we can choose more then the 6 shortcuts, that the widget allows.",4
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,"Good app, easy to use for navi, music, etc...",4
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Well I thank its kindaa cool,4
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,...but would automatic icon rotation be possible? Everyone I know drive with their phone landscape,5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,"Not an app but a useful widget so find it in the widget list, works well! Hope the main icon aesthetics could be improved in future...",5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,"The only usable feature in this widget, which is the car mode itself can only be activated in PRO version, otherwise it's just a bunch of buttons with shortcuts :S",1
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,I succeeded to i Install applications but there is no anywhere. I succeeded to uninstall.,1
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,When sensor is on should rotate the icons in the widget or have option to have them appear in landscape by choice,3

com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,"Doesn't work on RAZR, and can't even open the app.",1
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Pretty gloss idea with poor execution. Adding shortcuts must be done all in one shot from the settings menu along with other appearance changes in order for it to take. Once settings are changed oncewhat you see ifs what you get unless you wanna delete widget and start over. Uninstalling,2
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Handy tool may even go pro,5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,"I was very excited to try this app - I was looking for a replacement for the Google Car Home (which surprisingly doesn't work for Droid X2 either), but the shortcuts don't work, and it doesn't keep my edits.  Disappointed.",1

com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,If you enjoy driving your car and using your phone use this freakin app,5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Does what it says very well and without problems. Saves a lot of memory and stops you from having to use the slow and poorly written stock car home.,5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Heads up. Most apps use google cart for purchase. Almost none use paypal. It not nice to leave comments like that,4
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,"Tried the paid version to turn on in car mode.  However, app kept asking for upgrade to paid version.  Would have been nice if it had worked. No buy!",3

com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,This is the bomb. Totally customizable. No more app drawer while driving and its usable w/o an expensive magnetic cardock. Will buy pro for 99¬¢.,5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Works great on my DROIDX!!!!...,5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,There is no way to change the settings on the Charge. The icons max out the available screen and the settings (small) icon is therefore not available,1

com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,"Good-looking widget, use it for shortcuts to navigation, voice search, music app, soundhound (when I'm listening to the radio and want to know the song), and shortcuts to home and school on google maps. Very useful, improves safety too, just switch to the right homescreen and I've got all the important car options ready, instead of fiddling around with my phone when driving.",5
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,Free version is a waste of time,1
com.anod.car.home.free,A Google user,This trial is a joke because none of the options can be tested without buying the product! What a waste of time. The idea is to try it out before $,1
