Working great also on Galaxy S5 G900M klteub running LineageOS 15.1 (Oreo 8.1) and on Pie 9.0 (LineageOS 16.0).

com.pluscubed.matlog,A Google user,Solid logcat app with useful features. Can start recording with a filter both in app & using widget. Stop recording works in app and widget. Great can manage saved logcats in app. Works on both my rooted and unrooted device. Supports log entry copy to clipboard or save log to a text file. Thanks Devsüëèüèº Android 11,5

com.pluscubed.matlog,David Anderson,"Yes you can view the log - after running the Adb command. But, the Android log is chock full of entries so searchability is a big deal and that's where the app falls short. While I can isolate entries by search string I can't then navigate to the position of a given entry and view it in full context - big failing - and scrolling through is simply impossible due to volume of entries. And saved logs can't be opened in readable form looks like the compressed zip file is opened without decompression",3
