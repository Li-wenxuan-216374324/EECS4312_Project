Thanks to the few developement team for an excellent app. The only thing I would like to see it do better would be to add more manufacturer specific code interpretations.

OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,Eben Wight,"Functions as advertised with no added BS. I'm giving 4 rather than three because the support for manufacturer implemented PIDs is LEGIT. SOME NEEDED FEATURES: -Ability to edit/export/load logging and PID confs AT RUNTIME. I want to make presets, NOT to have to select everything by hand every single time. -Ability to import/edit PIDs from add-ons, (custom names e.g.) -Better graphing (4 variable max?!

OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,Tim P.,App Will not connect unless engine is running. Then when you go to read the DTC's a message pops up advising that you may want to turn the engine off because it may interfere with the engine. I turn the engine off but keep vehicle in on position and it disconnects. The only way to connect is with engine running. Requested refund through google play. If this is corrected I may return and buy it again. Also the app didn't have an in app search for BMW DTC p1112. The free app did.,2

OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,Keith Murray,"The most extensive ODB2 app on Google Play. I found no other app that can get all the advanced codes like ABS, AWD, and even the Bose amp faults like this one can with the Nissan addon. It was well worth the $15 for the app and addon, as a comparable handheld scanner costs many times this. I can even track the reading of my wheel speed sensors (one of which caused my ABS light to stay on) in real time. And one small issue I had was QUICKLY addressed by support. This is the OBD2 app you need!",5

What dont understand is how could this app state after testing that my SUV ready for emissions testing when it cant read the 02 senors? Have downgade it my stars.,2
OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,David,"Works well except for fuel usage and efficiency calculations. When the vehicle is idling, the indication is 0 l/100km. This leads to inaccurate fuel efficiency calculations because the average fuel efficiency actually ""improves"" the longer the vehicle idles. Update - I will check this again and reevaluate my rating if the app works as the developer indicated. The fuel efficiency calculations do seem to be working correctly. One star left open because the MAF sensor indicator always reads ""0"".",4

OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,Danny Iwama,"This is the best generic android based OBDII scanner for gathering data.  I use it to correct OBDII issues on vehicles that fail their bi-annual smog inspections.  Mode1 is able to display all SAE generic pids available in the PCM.   When it can, Mode6 CID are translated.  Mode9 shows In-use performance tracking.    When Permanent Codes are displayed, it shows  number of Warm up Cycles, and Miles traveled after code clear.  Very useful with the current California smog inspection.     If I had a wish list, it would be for better graphing of pids.   I use a different application for graphing pids.   All in all, this is an exceptional scanner app.",5

OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,c M,"Whole I appreciate the reply, that's not why I gave it a low rating.  The reason I gave it a low rating is because you gave us the ability to make custom displays with custom colors and sizes to then make a completely unique Dashboard, but with NO ability to SAVE that dashboard and then LOAD it later.  U had a great setup, and now it's gone and I have to start all over sgsin.  That's B.S.   You have the ""Add Dashboard"" option, but this function just tells us to use Add Displays.  What's the point?  There should be a Save Dashboard option, and a Load Dashboard option, and if you're going to have an Add Dashboard button, make it do something other than give me a stupid message to use the Add Displays.  Furthermore, I purchased a BaFx bluetooth DLC connector, so I'd say it's hardly a $5 Chinese knockoff.  Nevertheless. I'm sure I'm wrong about the PID defaults.  That doesn't change the fact that you give people the option to purchase additional data sets for other manufacturers,  but only SOME manufacturers like Toyota.",4

OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,Mike 213,"Have owned the paid version for approx a year now. It has literally saved me money. Have had times where my cluster panel on one of my vehicles was giving incorrect information, this app along with my OBDll reader helped me realize my gauges were faulty. Saved me from paying for a tow truck and/or having my mobile mechanic go out for service. I've diagnosed and confirmed issues on three different vehicles, made up of both foreign and American automakers prior to taking vehicles in for service. It also allows you to lookup trouble codes online, which helps you greatly understand what the issue is and possibly make the repair yourself.

Make it auto connect to the OBD reader, make the logs easy to set up, compile, and email or export (Dropbox is so 5 years ago, everyone's on Google Drive), and I'll update/change the review.",2
OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,Randy Sherwood,Thank you for allowing me to disable that connection error dialogue!  Just updated the app--will update this review if I encounter any new issues.  Fantastic app!,5

So far it does more then most 300  dollar scan tools! Keep up good work.about the update---to those with connection issues I feel your pain now....I figured out that it's because of all the new pid's !! Turn off the ""user defined pid's "" and app will work just fine. I think the problem is that there are 350 user pid's and most of us only need or can handle the pid's meant for our vehicles.",5
OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,Ky Ros,Best thing out there for obd,5
OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,Paul Amor,This app is okay but it's not overly special or convenient to use. Only reason I bought it is because it goes with the automatic adapter. If you're looking for a generic app to connect to OBD take a look at torque.,3
OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,Phillip Winfrey,Lots of features and a very modern interface. I'm using the app with my veepeak OBDcheck vp11.,5
OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,Michael Jolley,As of 11/16/16 I have used this app for about a week. I have had no issues. I use this app with the OBD device Automatic.

OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,Andrew Pearson,Absolutely amazing app if you have the Automatic adapter.  I've been waiting for DashCommand to support the Automatic adapter but this app is much much easier to look at and us.  The only suggestion I would make is to have a backup to Google Drive along with Dropbox.,5
OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,Mark Geier,Very average. Had check engine light on and app said all ok no mil.,1
OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,Adan Del Toro,Only was able to connect once but not long enough to get any codes or diagnose.I have an automatic Bluetooth odb device and that was paired with this app. I kept getting errors and I'd troubleshot and would connect the drop connection.frustrating. and to top it off I did all this within 30 min and I can't get a refund.,1

OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,MTS,"I use this app often while working in my shop. It does a pretty good job for the price. It's not your all in one scan tool but will help you in the right direction if you know what your doing. I'm happy to see in the update that air bag support has been added, I have not been able to test it yet so hopefully it works well. What I would like to see in the future is more pid support on misfire count. Also some heavy truck obd2 communication would be great, Example: Hino, fuso, some GMC.",4
OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,Nick Torres,"Great obd tool, excellent for checking fuel trims",5
OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,B M,Works with veepeak Bluetooth adapter and Alcatel Idol 3 phone.  The error codes are very technical.

OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,A Google user,"This app is wonderful and is presented in a clean and simple interface.  I have previously used Torque and this is as good or better.  Plugin support would be nice, but is not required.    Where this app shines though is the incredible customer support.

You simply cannot find a better team who cares about their customers more.  Thank you OCTech!",5

The Fuel MPG Monitoring options are cool. The other monitoring options are cool also. I like that I can track any changes in my MPG. and the error codes give me the data I need.

The free Torque ap was fine I left it connected for at least an hour. I'm using android 4.4.0 I do like the scan tool voltage display and the gauge layout is cleaner and easier to manage than torque. I plan to use this for trouble shooting and I have been using an Actron pocket scanner for years. The benefit here is the real time data. I hope it doesn't freeze up at a critical time.

OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,Ron Guensche,"Works like a charm on a generic MID 7"" tablet with a cheap elm327 USB device and OTG USB cable.   The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is the current version of the app asks (even when not running) every time a non-mouse/keyboard USB device is connected if you want to use it with Touch Scan.  EVERY SINGLE TIME.  Google's dialog does not have a 'never' button, so the message won't go away permanently.   The network card in my tablet is USB, so every time I wake the tablet or power on, I get a dialog asking if I want to launch TS.  Renders my tablet a PITA to use. My solution for the time being is to remove the app when it's not needed, and reinstall it when it is.   Not ideal, but hey, that's why 3 stars.  FWIW: the support from OCTech was great in figuring out that this is the nature of the beast until the program gets updated (if it does) or google adds a 'never' button to the dialog in question.",3
OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,Brent Bolinger,"I use the obd apps all the time, if not just for my vehicles i use them on friends vehicles as well. i have the torque pro app and am a seasoned mechanic, but the ease of  use of this app is the best by far. also add- ons and guages are free ! five stars here. ;)",5

OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,A Google user,Connection works now better.,3
OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,A Google user,"There are two issues I often find with OBD applications: They do not reliably connect and/or their UI is complex and inconsistent.  TouchScan does not have these issues. On the main page there are connect/disconnect buttons and status indicators.  During the connection process, TouchScan displays each step as it progresses, assuring me that it is not stuck or lost. If it fails to connect, a message is displayed explaining why it failed and possible causes.  Honestly, this is probably the most straight forward UI I’ve come across. There are six well named icons on the home page that categorize all the different features. Within most categories, the data/content is separated by named tags. I prefer this over sliding through whole pages or having a never ending scroll bar. This further organizes the data, making it quick and easy to find what you’re looking for.  Pros: Easy to Connect, Detailed Vehicle Report (VIN, emissions readiness, etc), Stream Live Data, Strong Connection Algorithm, Great Technical Support, Pretty. Cons: No graphs (at this time), Connectivity issues w/Chinese devices. ~Embedded Design Engineer",5
OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,A Google user,Finally they fixed CONNECTION ERRORS!!!,4
OCTech.Mobile.Applications.TouchScan,A Google user,"If you are looking for an app for both general day-to-day use and decent diagnostics, I would definitely recommend this one. The dashboards are nice because you can create multiple pages and completely customize the parameters being displayed. Switching dashboards is as easy as swiping left or right. For diagnostics, the Report gives you access to all diagnostic data on one screen, which you can save and recall for later viewing. This is useful since it can be difficult browsing all the data while connected to your vehicle. The report data appears to be saved separately for each vehicle that you connect, so it's easy to use if you scan multiple vehicles.   I have two bluetooth adapters, a more expensive adapter and a cheap ebay clone. At first, I could only reliably connect with my expensive adapter. However, after the latest software update, both adapters appear to be working flawlessly. If you haven't updated and are having problems, make sure you download the latest version.",5

org.eobdfacile.android,George Soroceanu,"Always crashes if the elm327 wifi is turned off, instead of a simple disconnection. Also crashed randomly. Otherwise, reasonable app but, for this price, it should be much more reliable... They should also integrate their other app, which shows OBD2 connector placement, by car. (Anyway, that database is ridiculously outdated - come on, it's 2014...at least try to include most popular European cars of the last decade)  P.S: In relation to the developer's reply below - It is obvious the other app is collaborative but, that port lookup should be a feature inside the paid EOBD app.  As long as the main app is much more expensive than TorquePRO, for example, at least it should offer much more.  Beside this, that extra app should not be collaborative. It is really not so difficult to add much many (at least, European) car model OBD2 port locations. There are many common cars missing and that info is not so difficult to be found, on the internet, with a bit of research.  Fix all these and raise EOBD2 Facile app to the level of its price and you will have, for sure, a much better rating.",3

Especially after taking it to a Firestone for a tune up and CV Axle replacement and after 2 days they asked me to come to the shop. I was told my transmission was the issue and that I needed to take it to a transmission specialist. My OBD helped me fix the true problem for around $200 instead of possibly much more.

The best part is the live diagnostics when engine is running. Allows me to see the values coming from whatever sensors I have chosen to see displayed at that time. I believe it shows 6 at once. Example being I can see how far timing is advanced while monitoring the throttle position. Works great for my needs,5

once every 6 months when something may be wrong with their car. There are 
better apps on the store that don't require subscriptions. Responding to 
developer: I know you may subscribe and unsubscribe at any time, but that's 
not the point. The point is that every couple months I would have to pay a 
fee to use the app in any useful way, and I would only need for one 1-2

com.obdautodoctor,A Google user,"I am really excited to share my experiences with this app. I was very interested to hear .... Upgrade to the PRO version of this review to read the rest!  But seriously, the UI is OK, but the main menus seems only for navigation. Everything you need to do (connect to OBD, select sensors, etc) resides hidden behind the menu key. This seems like an inefficient use of screen real estate. Also, the fact that all detailed sensors are PRO only means I couldn't even try the app out. How do you expect a customer to evaluate your app if they don't have a CEL to check? There are other functions that people expect out of an OBD app and if you don't allow any kind of evaluation, then you've lost a customer. I understand not wanting to go ad-supported, but you could offer a timed feature (5-minutes of sensor data per boot-up or 24 hour period) or limit viewing sensor data to one at a time.",2
