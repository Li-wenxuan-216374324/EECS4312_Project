sk.madzik.android.logcatudp,A Google user,"When I saw this I knew I had to utilize it with my arduino Ethernet board. As of now, I've got it configured to output received packets over serial but will be enjoying myself very much when it's a single unit displaying my logcat on an LCD screen. I would like to know why I am receiving my logcat packets from source IPs external to my network? Some appear from the androids IP but most others from a handful of outside IPs. Either I've missed something simple or the app routes traffic out(hopefully unlikely)",5
