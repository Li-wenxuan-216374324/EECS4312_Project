scd.lcex,jack sparrow,"i think something is broken in latest update, no logs are showing or being saved. no idea if it's error on my side but previously on a different rom it was working great & the record logs (auto saves in a file) option really helped a lot when had to capture logs of device restarting at a specific event.",5

scd.lcex,beast gamer717,works extreamly well logs everything,5
scd.lcex,Prestor John,this app has been a huge help in keeping track of logging information due to the fact that I have had a very very serious problem with being hacked and this app has been a huge help in keeping track of logging information due to remote access being utilized on my devices what I wanted to ask the developer is I was wondering if there is a similar app made for Windows due to the fact that my Windows laptop is also being seriously hacked this is been a serious ongoing problem for over a year,5

scd.lcex,Alvin Williamson Jr.,Needs to be updated. Im running api 28.,1
scd.lcex,A Google user,This app is an invaluable tool. I have used it many times to diagnose and fix hundreds of apps and Android system problems where nothing else would provide me with any information to work with. Also it is the best of its kind that I have found after testing a dozen. Then I bought the Pro version to support its development. Thanks dev for creating it and keep up the good work !,5

scd.lcex,Troy Dalton,"I was beginning to give up on useful tools to help develop directly on my tablet!  Because of health reasons, I cannot sit at my PC for long periods of time. I write using AIDE, then do my final compiles on my computer. This app has been the greatest help of any other tool I've used (not just log readers).  Thanks SCDevs!  I especially like the ability to call the app from my code.  Logcat Extreme is nothing short of awesome!  Keep it up.  I look forward to new, innovative features.  Now, I'm off to buy the paid version.....",5

scd.lcex,Chris Hiles,Only app found for KitKat that recorded / continuously saved log files correctly.,5
scd.lcex,Colin Lammie,This logcat reader is the best out of the 3 I've tried. I read the last 10 one star reviews and they didn't disappoint! I'd give these people one star except they know how to breathe so they deserve two.,5
